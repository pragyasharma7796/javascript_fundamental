Unary operators: which require one operand (Un)
These operators require one operand for operation.
Providing two or more can result in a syntax error. 
Here are some examples of operators that fall under this category.
The typeof operator returns the data type of a value. It requires only one operand.
 Here's an example:

typeof "hello"
// string

Binary operators: which require two operands (Bi)`

These operators require two operands for operation. 
If one or more than two operands are provided, such operators result in a syntax error.
Arithmetic Operators
10 + 20
// 30
Comparison Operators
80 < 20
// false

These operators require three operands.
 In JavaScript, there is one operator that falls under this category â€“ the conditional operator. 
In other languages, perhaps, there could be more examples.
