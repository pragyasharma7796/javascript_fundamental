Operators are used in programming to perform operation on variables and values;

In programming languages, operators are symbols or commands that instruct a computer to perform certain operations,
 such as arithmetic calculations (like addition and subtraction), string manipulations, logical comparisons 
 (such as greater than or equal to) and more. Depending on the language used, an operator can have multiple functionalities;
  for instance an ‘=’ symbol may be used to assign values but also for comparison in some programming languages.
   Operators are crucial building blocks of any programing language since they allow us to utilize all the power of
computers when writing code.
