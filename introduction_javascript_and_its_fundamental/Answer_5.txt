Comments
• Programming languages have a commenting feature that allows you to document your code and
provide explanations in a way that humans can understand. When multiple developers collaborate on a
codebase, comments are helpful for clarifying the purpose of specific code sections.
• Additionally, comments can be used to deactivate code temporarily. This Is beneficial when you want to
test something without completely removing the code.
• Comments can also serve as a to-do list, helping you keep track of tasks that need to be completed in
the future.


1-> Single Line Comment
In JavaScript. single line comments are created by using two forward slashes '//'. Anything after the two
forward slashes will be ignored by the JavoScript interpreter. This is useful when you want to add a comment
to a single line of code.

Notes:
A JS interpreter is a program that executes JavaScript code line by line, producing the desired output. It is
essential for running JavaScript in different environments like web browsers or servers.
syntax:

// This is a single line comment
console.log(’Hello World); // This is a single line comment

2-> Multi Line Comments
In JavaScript, multi line comments are created by using '/*' and '*/'. Anything between the two symbols will
be ignored by the JavaScript interpreter. This is useful when you want to add a comment to multiple lines of
code.
syntax : 
/*
This is a multi line comment
