JavaScript :- JavaScript is o popular programming language that is widely used to build web applications. It is a client-side
scripting language, which means that it is run by your web browser rather than on a server. This makes it a
good choice for building web applications that need to be fast and responsive, as the code is run locally on the
users device rather than having to be sent back and forth between o server and a client. JavaScript is also
used to build mobile apps, create interactive documents, and build server-side applications with the help of
runtime environments such as Node.js.

Some of the Common role of Js:

1. Web Development: JavaScript ¡s primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic elements to websites. It
allows developers to create responsive user interfaces, handle user interactions, and update web page
content without requiring a full page reload.

2. Web Applications: With the help of modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js,
developers can build powerful and complex web applications that provide a smooth user experience similar
to traditional desktop applications.

3. Server-SIde Development: JavaScript is used with Node.js to build server-side applications. Node.js allows
developers to create high-performance, scalable, and event-driven server applications that can handle a
large number of simultaneous connections.

4. MobIle App Development: JavaScript is used in combination with frameworks like React Native and Ionic to
develop cross-platform mobile applications that run on both Android and ¡OS devices. This approach allows
developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms.

5. Game Development: With the arrival of HTML5 and WebGL JavaScnpt has become a practical option for
making games that can be played directly In web browsers. Game engines like Phaser and Threejs make it
easy for developers to create fun and visually attractive games using JavaScript

6. .Browser Extensions: JavaScript is commonly used to develop browser extensions and add-ons that
enhance the functionality of web browsers, adding new features or customizing the browsers behavior.

7. Data Visualization: JavaScript, along with libraries like D3.js and Chart.js, Is employed to create interactive
and informative data visualizations on web pages, making complex data more accessible to users.

8. Real-time Applications: JavaScripfs support for asynchronous programming makes it ideal for building
real-time applications like chat applications, collaborative tools, and live data dashboards.
9. AutomatIon: JavaScript can be used in automation to build applications.
