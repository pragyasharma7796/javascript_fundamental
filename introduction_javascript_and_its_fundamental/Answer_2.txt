Key differnce in JavaScript and html :
1. Purpose: HTML is used for creating the structure and content of a web page, while JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to a web page.

2. Syntax: HTML uses markup tags to define elements, while JavaScript uses scripting language syntax.

3. Rendering: HTML is rendered by the browser, while JavaScript is executed by the browser.

4. Dynamic behavior: HTML has no built-in capabilities for creating dynamic behavior, while JavaScript can dynamically change content, styles, and respond to user interactions.

5. Separation from content: JavaScript can be separated from the HTML and placed in a separate file, while HTML is tightly integrated with the content of a web page.

6. Interoperability: HTML is supported by all browsers, while JavaScript implementation may vary among browsers.

7. Server interaction: HTML is static and has no capability for interacting with a server, while JavaScript can communicate with a server and exchange data dynamically.

8. Learning curve: HTML has a relatively low learning curve, while JavaScript has a steeper learning curve due to its scripting language syntax and dynamic capabilities.
