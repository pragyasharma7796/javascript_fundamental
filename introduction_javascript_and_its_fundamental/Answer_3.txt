Primitive Data type: Stored directly in the location that the variable is accessed.

Following are the 7 primitive types in javascript
1. String : Combination of alphanumeric characters wrapped in either single or double quotes. Strings can include any
number, letter or symbol.
JavaScript
"Prabir" or 'Prabir'

2. Number : Any number in JavaScript is the Number type, including floats and decimals. Some languages have separate
types for floats and integers. JavaScript does not. Numbers are not wrapped in quotes.

javaScript
3e
98.9

NaN stands for “Not a Number” and is a special value that represents the result of an undefined or
unrepresentable mathematical operation.

3. BigInt:
In JavaScript, there is a maximum safe value, which is approximately 2A53 - 1. Similarly, there is also a
minimum safe value, which is approximate -(2A53 - 1).
This means that integers less than min safe value or greater than max safe value, may lose precision when
represented as a JavaScript number. So, for such numbers, we use Biglnt data type.
The Biglnt data type number can also be treated as a regular number by adding n to it at the end.

4. Boolean:
A boolean ¡s o true or false value.

JavaScript
true or false

5. Null: Null means nothing or empty value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or property has no value. 

javaScript
null

6. undefined : undefined is a special value that indicates that a variable or property has been declared but has not been
assigned a value.
undefined

7. Symbol: A Javascript Symbol is a relatively new javascript feature. it was introduced in ES6. This is a new Primitive data
type called Symbol. Symbols are immutable e means can not be changed and are unique.

JavaScript
Symbol( " name")
